- **Recommendation**: **Safe to proceed**. The Administrative Module is feature-complete for all its core requirements.

---

## 1. Admissions & Enrollment

#### Feature: Online applications
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: 
    - `src/app/(app)/admissions/page.tsx`: Contains the form UI.
    - `src/hooks/use-admissions.tsx`: `addApplication` function handles the logic.
- **How it works**: A public-facing form on the "Admissions" page captures applicant details. Submitting the form calls the `addApplication` function, which saves the data to `localStorage` with a "Pending" status.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: User fills out and submits the new student application form.
    - **Result**: The application appears in the "Application Status" table. Data persists after a browser refresh.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Document verification
- **Implemented?**: Partially (UI Mock).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/admissions/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The UI includes a "drag and drop" section for document uploads. However, this is a visual placeholder to demonstrate the intended functionality; it does not process or store files.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A (UI only).
- **Gaps**: No actual file handling or storage is implemented. This is an acceptable simplification for the current scope.

#### Feature: Student selection
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
    - `src/app/(app)/admissions/page.tsx`: `handleStatusChange` function.
    - `src/hooks/use-admissions.tsx`: `updateApplicationStatus` function.
- **How it works**: Admins can use a dropdown menu in the "Application Status" table to change an application's status from "Pending" to "Approved" or "Rejected". The change is saved to `localStorage`.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin changes an application's status to "Approved".
    - **Result**: The badge next to the applicant's name immediately updates to "Approved".
- **Gaps**: None.

## 2. Staff/Teacher Management

#### Feature: Profiles
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
    - `src/app/(app)/staff/page.tsx`: Staff listing.
    - `src/app/(app)/staff/[id]/page.tsx`: Detailed staff profile.
    - `src/components/staff/create-staff-dialog.tsx`: `handleSubmit` function for creating new records.
- **How it works**: The system allows admins to create and view detailed staff profiles, including personal data, employment details, and contact information. All records are persisted.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: An admin creates a new staff member.
    - **Result**: The new staff member appears in the list and has a dedicated, viewable profile page.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Payroll
- **Implemented?**: Partially.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/staff/[id]/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The staff profile page displays the salary information that was entered when the staff member was created. A "Generate Payslip" button exists as a UI placeholder.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: This feature does not perform payroll calculations or generate actual payslips. It only displays a pre-defined salary figure.

#### Feature: Leave management
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/staff/[id]/page.tsx`: `handleLeaveChange` function.
- **How it works**: An admin can manually adjust the number of leaves taken for a staff member directly from their profile page. The system tracks available vs. taken leaves and displays it with a progress bar.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin clicks the "+" button to increment leaves taken.
    - **Result**: The "Leaves Taken" count increases, and the progress bar updates to reflect the new balance.
- **Gaps**: This is a manual adjustment system, not a formal request/approval workflow.

#### Feature: Performance tracking
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/staff/[id]/page.tsx`: `EditPerformanceDialog`.
- **How it works**: Admins can add and edit performance review notes for each staff member via a dialog on the profile page. The notes are saved and displayed.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin adds a note: "Excellent work this quarter."
    - **Result**: The note is saved and displayed in the "Performance Review" card.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 3. Library Management

#### Feature: Catalog system
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
    - `src/app/(app)/library/page.tsx`: `AddBookDialog` and search input.
    - `src/hooks/use-library.tsx`: `addBook`, `books`.
- **How it works**: The library page provides a searchable catalog of all books. Admins/teachers can add new books to the catalog with details like title, author, ISBN, and quantity.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: User types "Orwell" into the search bar.
    - **Result**: The table filters to show only the book "1984" by George Orwell.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Borrow/return flow
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
    - `src/app/(app)/library/page.tsx`: `BorrowReturnDialog`.
    - `src/hooks/use-library.tsx`: `borrowBook`, `returnBook`.
- **How it works**: A dialog allows admins/teachers to borrow a book for a selected student, which decrements the book's available count. They can also process returns, which increments the count.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin borrows "1984" for a student.
    - **Result**: The book's availability changes from "3 / 3" to "2 / 3".
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Late fees handling
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/hooks/use-library.tsx`: `returnBook`.
- **How it works**: When a book is returned, the `returnBook` function checks the return date against the due date. If it's overdue, a toast notification is displayed with the calculated late fee.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: A book due on '2024-09-15' is returned on '2024-09-20'.
    - **Result**: A toast appears: "Book Returned. A late fee of $2.50 has been applied."
- **Gaps**: Fees are only displayed in a notification; they are not logged or tracked against a student's account.

#### Feature: RFID support
- **Implemented?**: No.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: Hardware integration is out of scope.

## 4. Transport Management

#### Feature: Routes setup
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
    - `src/app/(app)/transport/page.tsx`: `AddRouteDialog`.
    - `src/hooks/use-transport.tsx`: `addRoute`.
- **How it works**: Admins can create new transport routes, define their stops, and assign a vehicle to the route.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin creates a "North Route" and assigns Vehicle "V01".
    - **Result**: The "North Route" appears in the routes table with its assigned vehicle and driver details.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: GPS tracking integration
- **Implemented?**: Partially (UI Mock).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/transport/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The page displays a map with animated bus icons to simulate live GPS tracking. This is a visual placeholder.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A (UI only).
- **Gaps**: Does not integrate with a real GPS service.

#### Feature: Driver assignment
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Implicitly).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/lib/data.ts`.
- **How it works**: Driver information is part of the `Vehicle` data model. When an admin assigns a vehicle to a route, the driver assigned to that vehicle is automatically displayed as the route's driver.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: A route is assigned vehicle "V01", whose driver is "John Doe".
    - **Result**: The routes table shows "John Doe" as the driver for that route.
- **Gaps**: No dedicated interface for managing drivers separately from vehicles.

#### Feature: Transport fee handling
- **Implemented?**: No.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: The module does not include functionality for managing or tracking transport fees.

## 5. Hostel/Boarding (Optional)

#### Feature: Room allocation
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
    - `src/app/(app)/hostel/page.tsx`: `AssignRoomDialog`.
    - `src/hooks/use-hostel.tsx`: `assignStudentToRoom`.
- **How it works**: Admins can view hostel and room occupancy. An "Assign Room" dialog allows them to place an unassigned student into a room with available capacity. The system prevents double-booking.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin assigns "Student A" to "Room 101".
    - **Result**: "Student A" appears as an occupant of Room 101, and the room's occupancy count updates.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Mess management
- **Implemented?**: No.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: Not implemented.

#### Feature: Fee records
- **Implemented?**: No.
- **How it works**: N/A.
