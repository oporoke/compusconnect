# Financial Module: Audit & Verification Checklist

## Module Summary
- **Implementation Status**: 90%
- **Critical Missing Features**: 
    1. Automated reminders for pending dues.
    2. Expense tracking for items other than payroll.
- **Recommendation**: **Do not proceed**. While the core functionality is robust, the absence of automated reminders and comprehensive expense tracking means the module does not fully meet the accounting requirements. These features should be implemented before finalizing the module.

## 1. Fee Management & Accounting

#### Feature: Configurable fee structures
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/settings/page.tsx` (`AddFeeStructureDialog`), `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx` (`addFeeStructure`).
- **How it works**: Admins can define various fee types (e.g., tuition, activities) with specific amounts and applicable grades via a dialog. This data is saved to `localStorage`, making the fee system fully configurable.
- **Test Evidence**: 
    - **Action**: Admin creates a new fee structure: Name="Science Lab Fee", Amount=75, Grades="11,12".
    - **Result**: The "Science Lab Fee" now appears in the list on the settings page and is available for selection when generating new invoices.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Invoice generation
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (`GenerateInvoicesDialog`), `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx` (`generateInvoicesForGrade`).
- **How it works**: The system allows an admin to generate invoices in batches for an entire grade. The admin selects the grade and one or more fee structures, and an invoice is created for each student.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin selects "Grade 10" and checks "Annual Tuition" and "Activity Fee", then clicks "Generate".
    - **Result**: New invoices are created for all students in Grade 10, each with line items for tuition and activity fees.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Payment recording & receipts (PDF/printable)
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (`RecordPaymentDialog`, `ViewInvoiceDialog`), `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx` (`addPayment`).
- **How it works**: Admins can record payments against any invoice. The invoice status automatically updates from "Unpaid" to "Paid" when the total amount is covered. A detailed view of each invoice, including payments made, can be printed or downloaded as a PDF receipt.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin records a $5200 payment for an invoice and clicks "View", then "Print/Download".
    - **Result**: The invoice status updates to "Paid". A PDF file is downloaded, showing all line items, payments, and a final balance of $0.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Automated reminders for pending dues
- **Implemented?**: No.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: The system currently does not include any functionality for sending automated reminders for overdue invoices. This would require a background service or scheduled task to check due dates and trigger notifications, which has not been built.

## 2. Payroll Processing (Teachers/Staff)

#### Feature: Salary details & deduction rules
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/lib/data.ts` (`Staff` interface), `src/components/staff/create-staff-dialog.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The `Staff` data model in `src/lib/data.ts` has been extended to include a `deductions` object with `tax` and `insurance` fields. This data is part of the staff creation and management process.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: An admin creates a staff member with a salary of $60,000 and sets their tax deduction rate.
    - **Result**: This data is stored and is accessible for payroll calculations.
- **Gaps**: Deduction rules are currently limited to tax (percentage) and insurance (fixed amount). A more complex, rule-based engine is not implemented but is not required by the current scope.

#### Feature: Net salary calculation
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx` (`runPayrollForMonth`).
- **How it works**: The `runPayrollForMonth` function automatically fetches each staff member's gross salary and deduction details. It calculates the net salary by subtracting the deductions from the gross pay.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin runs payroll for a staff member with $5000 gross salary and $800 in deductions.
    - **Result**: A payroll record is created showing a net salary of $4200.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Payslip generation (downloadable)
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/payroll/page.tsx` (`handleDownloadPayslip`).
- **How it works**: The payroll history table includes a "Download Payslip" button for each record. This action uses `jsPDF` to generate a formatted PDF document containing the gross salary, deductions, and net salary for that specific month.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin clicks the "Payslip" button for a payroll record.
    - **Result**: The browser downloads a PDF file named `payslip_[staff_name]_[month].pdf`.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Payroll history tracking
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/payroll/page.tsx`, `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx`.
- **How it works**: Every time payroll is run for a month, a new `PayrollRecord` is created and stored. The "Payroll History" page displays a complete list of all past payroll records, which persist in `localStorage`.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin runs payroll for "2024-10" and then again for "2024-11".
    - **Result**: The history table correctly displays separate, distinct records for both months.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 3. Transport & Hostel Fees

#### Feature: Integration with fee structure
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/lib/data.ts`, `src/app/(app)/finance/settings/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The `feeStructures` data model is generic. Admins can create fee types for any purpose, including "Transport Fee" or "Hostel Fee", from the settings page. These are then available to be added to invoices.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin creates a new fee structure named "Hostel Fee".
    - **Result**: "Hostel Fee" can now be selected when generating invoices.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Transport and Hostel fee tracking
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: Transport and hostel fees are tracked as line items within the standard invoice system. Their payment status is tied to the overall status of the invoice they belong to, providing a unified tracking mechanism.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: An invoice containing a "Transport Fee" is marked as "Paid".
    - **Result**: The system correctly considers the transport fee as settled.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Combined invoices
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (`GenerateInvoicesDialog`).
- **How it works**: The invoice generation tool allows the selection of multiple fee structures simultaneously. This creates a single, combined invoice for a student that can include tuition, transport, hostel, and any other defined fees.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Admin generates an invoice for a student with "Tuition Fee" and "Hostel Fee" selected.
    - **Result**: The student receives one invoice with both charges listed, and a single total amount due.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 4. Financial Reports

#### Feature: Income and Expense summary
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Income), Partially (Expense).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The financial dashboard correctly calculates and displays "Total Income" by summing up all recorded payments. "Total Expenses" are calculated by summing up only the net salary from payroll records.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: A payment of $500 is recorded, and a payroll of $2000 is processed.
    - **Result**: The dashboard shows Total Income as $500 and Total Expenses as $2000.
- **Gaps**: The expense tracking is incomplete. It only accounts for payroll and does not include a way to log or categorize other operational expenses (e.g., purchases, maintenance), which is a key requirement for a full financial summary.

#### Feature: Pending dues and Overall accounts balance
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The dashboard calculates "Pending Dues" by summing the total amount of all invoices not marked as "Paid". The "Account Balance" is then calculated as Total Income - Total Expenses.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: With $10000 income, $4000 expenses, and a $500 unpaid invoice.
    - **Result**: Dashboard shows Pending Dues: $500, Account Balance: $6000.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Exportable reports (PDF/Excel)
- **Implemented?**: Yes (PDF).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx` (`exportToPDF`).
- **How it works**: The dashboard has an "Export Summary" button that uses `jsPDF` and `jspdf-autotable` to generate a summary PDF. This report includes key metrics (income, expenses, dues) and a table of recent invoices.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: User clicks the "Export Summary" button.
    - **Result**: A PDF file named `financial_report.pdf` is downloaded.
- **Gaps**: The requirement specified PDF/Excel, but only PDF export is implemented. Excel export functionality is missing.
