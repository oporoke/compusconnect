## 1. Automated Reminders for Fees

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (`sendReminders` function).
- **How it works**: An admin can click the "Send Reminders" button on the invoices page. The system then scans for all invoices that are both "Unpaid" and past their `dueDate`. For each overdue invoice, it triggers a toast notification, simulating an email reminder being sent to the student's parent.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: An invoice due on '2024-09-01' is still unpaid on '2024-09-10'. Admin clicks "Send Reminders".
    - **Result**: A toast notification appears: "Reminder Sent to [Student Name]".
- **Gaps**: This is a manual trigger, not a true automated cron job, which is an acceptable simulation for this application's architecture.

## 2. Mobile Money & Fintech Integrations

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (`PaymentGatewayDialog`), `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx` (`addPayment`).
- **How it works**: The "Pay Online" button on an invoice opens a dialog with tabs for Card, M-Pesa, and Fee Financing. Submitting these mock forms triggers a toast notification and calls the existing `addPayment` hook, which then updates the invoice status, simulating auto-reconciliation.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: On the Invoices page, click "Pay Online" for an unpaid invoice, enter mock card details, and click "Pay".
    - **Result**: A toast confirms the payment, and the invoice's status badge updates to "Paid".
- **Gaps**: No real payment processing occurs. This is a UI/UX mock awaiting API integration with a real payment gateway provider.

## 3. Predictive Cashflow & Arrears Alerts

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The main Financial Dashboard now includes:
    1.  A "Multi-Year Financial Overview" line chart comparing mock income vs. expense data over several years.
    2.  A "Fee Default Risk" table that simulates the output of a predictive model, flagging students with a high, medium, or low risk of defaulting on payments.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Navigate to the `/finance` dashboard.
    - **Result**: Both the multi-year line chart and the risk analysis table are rendered with mock data.
- **Gaps**: The financial data for previous years is hardcoded, and the risk analysis is a simple static table, not the result of a real predictive algorithm.

## 4. AI-based Payroll Anomaly Detection

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/payroll/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: On the Payroll page, a "Review Payroll" button opens an alert dialog that displays a mock warning about a potential payroll anomaly, demonstrating where such a feature would be integrated.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: On the payroll page, click the "Review Payroll" button.
    - **Result**: An alert dialog appears with the message: "Warning: Samuel Jones's net pay is 15% higher than last month's average...".
- **Gaps**: No real AI model is called. The analysis is static and for demonstration purposes only.
