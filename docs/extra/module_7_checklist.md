## 1. Canteen Management

### Feature: Prepaid cards

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/hooks/use-canteen.tsx`: `addFunds` and `recordPurchase` functions.
  - `src/app/(app)/canteen/page.tsx`: `AddFundsDialog` and `RecordPurchaseDialog` components.
- **How it works**: A student's canteen account balance is managed via a hook. Admins can add funds to an account or record a purchase, which deducts from the balance. The system prevents purchases if funds are insufficient.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Admin uses "Add Funds" to add $20 to a student's account. Then, uses "Record Purchase" for a $5 item.
  - **Result**: The student's balance first increases to $20, then decreases to $15. Two transactions (one credit, one debit) are logged.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Daily transactions logging

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/hooks/use-canteen.tsx`: `transactions` state.
  - `src/app/(app)/canteen/page.tsx`: The "Transactions" tab displays the history.
- **How it works**: Every `addFunds` or `recordPurchase` action automatically creates a new transaction record with a timestamp, student ID, type (credit/debit), amount, and description. This history is persisted and displayed in a filterable table.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Admin processes a purchase for a student.
  - **Result**: A new row appears at the top of the transaction history table showing the date, student name, "debit" type, and purchase amount.
- **Gaps**: While all transactions are logged, there is no specific date-range filter UI yet, but the underlying data structure supports it.

#### Feature: Food menus

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/hooks/use-canteen.tsx`: `updateMenu` function.
  - `src/app/(app)/canteen/page.tsx`: `MenuManager` component.
- **How it works**: A dedicated "Menu" tab allows an admin to manage the weekly canteen menu. They can add, edit, or remove food items and their prices for each day of the week, and save the changes.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Admin changes Monday's "Pizza Slice" price from $2.50 to $2.75 and clicks "Save Menu".
  - **Result**: The menu is updated. When recording a new purchase, the "Pizza Slice" item now correctly shows the new price of $2.75.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 2. Alumni Management

### Feature: Alumni database

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/hooks/use-alumni.tsx`: `addAlumni`, `updateAlumni` functions.
  - `src/app/(app)/alumni/page.tsx`: `AddAlumniDialog` for creating and editing profiles.
- **How it works**: The system provides a dedicated page for managing alumni. Authorized users can add new alumni profiles with details like graduation year, contact info, and career information. All profiles are persisted and can be edited.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: User clicks "Add Alumni", fills out the form for "Jane Doe", and saves.
  - **Result**: "Jane Doe" immediately appears in the alumni directory table.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Networking

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/alumni/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The alumni directory page includes a live search bar that filters the list of alumni by name, occupation, or company in real-time. This provides a simple but effective way to find and connect with other alumni.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: User types "Engineer" into the search bar.
  - **Result**: The table dynamically filters to show only alumni whose "Occupation" field contains "Engineer".
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Donations tracking

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/hooks/use-alumni.tsx`: `addDonation` function.
  - `src/app/(app)/alumni/page.tsx`: `AddDonationDialog` and "Donations" tab.
- **How it works**: Admins can record donations from alumni, specifying the donor, amount, and purpose. All donations are logged with a timestamp and displayed in a "Donations" tab, providing a clear history of contributions.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Admin records a $500 donation from "John Smith" for the "Library Fund".
  - **Result**: A new entry appears in the donations table showing the date, donor name, purpose, and amount.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 3. Health Center

### Feature: Medical records

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/hooks/use-health.tsx`: `updateRecord` function.
  - `src/app/(app)/health/page.tsx`: `EditHealthRecordDialog`.
- **How it works**: The Health Center page allows an admin to select a student and view or edit their medical record. This includes fields for blood group, allergies, and a list of vaccinations with dates.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Admin selects a student, clicks "Edit Record", adds "Pollen" to the allergies list, and saves.
  - **Result**: The student's profile immediately displays "Pollen" in the allergies section.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Clinic visits logging

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/hooks/use-health.tsx`: `addClinicVisit` function.
  - `src/app/(app)/health/page.tsx`: `LogVisitDialog`.
- **How it works**: For any selected student, an admin can log a new clinic visit, documenting the reason for the visit and the treatment provided. These visits are timestamped and displayed in a chronological history.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Admin logs a visit for a student with "Headache" as the reason and "Rest and hydration" as the treatment.
  - **Result**: A new entry for the visit appears in the "Clinic Visits" table for that student.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Vaccination records

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/health/page.tsx`: `EditHealthRecordDialog`.
- **How it works**: Within the "Edit Health Record" dialog, there is a dedicated section for managing vaccinations. Admins can dynamically add or remove vaccination entries, each with a name and a date.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Admin adds a new vaccination entry for "Flu Shot" with today's date and saves the record.
  - **Result**: The "Flu Shot" and date now appear in the vaccinations table on the student's health profile.
- **Gaps**: None.
