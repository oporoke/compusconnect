# Communication Module: Competitive Feature Audit

## Module Summary

- **Implementation Status**: 25% (Mocked)
- **Critical Missing Features**: Automated Notifications, WhatsApp Micro-Portal.
- **Recommendation**: **Do not proceed**. The core competitive features require backend functionality that cannot be implemented in the current frontend-only architecture.

---

## 1. Automated Notifications (SMS, Email, Push, WhatsApp)

- **Implemented?**: No.
- **File & Function Name**: N/A.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: This feature is entirely dependent on a backend server to integrate with third-party APIs for sending communications (e.g., Twilio for SMS/WhatsApp, SendGrid for email). It is not possible to implement this on the frontend. The existing "Send Reminders" button in the finance module serves as a basic simulation of this concept.

## 2. WhatsApp Micro-Portal

- **Implemented?**: No.
- **File & Function Name**: N/A.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: This feature requires a backend webhook to receive and respond to messages from the WhatsApp Business API. It cannot be implemented or mocked on the frontend.

## 3. Event Calendar Sync

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/events/page.tsx`, `handleAddToCalendar` function.
- **How it works**: The Events page displays "Add to Google Calendar" and "Add to Outlook" buttons next to each upcoming event. Clicking a button does not initiate a real API call but triggers a toast notification to simulate the action.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Navigate to the `/events` page and click the "Add to Google" button for an event.
  - **Result**: A toast notification appears with the message: "Adding to Google Calendar. Event '[Event Name]' has been added to your calendar. (This is a mock action)".
- **Gaps**: This is a UI/UX mock only. No actual integration with Google Calendar or Outlook APIs is performed.

---

## 4. Document Vault Integration for Announcements

- **Implemented?**: No.
- **File & Function Name**: N/A.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: This requires integration with the Document Vault module, which is a separate feature. The current announcements system only supports text content.

---

## Final Status

**Recommendation**: **Do not proceed**. The most critical competitive features (automated notifications and WhatsApp integration) are fundamentally backend-dependent and cannot be built in this environment. The calendar sync has been mocked for UI/UX demonstration purposes.
