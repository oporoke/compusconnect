# Academic Module: Competitive Feature Audit

## Module Summary

- **Implementation Status**: 100% (Mocked)
- **Critical Missing Features**: None. All requested features have been implemented as high-fidelity mocks.
- **Recommendation**: **Safe to proceed**. The frontend is ready for backend integration.

## 1. Advanced Grading

### Feature: GPA/Honor Roll Engine & Multi-Curriculum Support

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/students/[id]/page.tsx`
- **How it works**: The student profile page now includes a card that displays a mock GPA (e.g., "3.8/4.0") and an "Honor Roll" status badge. This is a UI simulation awaiting a backend engine for real calculations.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Navigate to any student's profile page (e.g., `/students/S001`).
  - **Result**: A new card titled "Advanced Grading" is visible, showing a static GPA and Honor Roll status.
- **Gaps**: No backend calculation engine exists. This is a UI mock only.

#### Feature: Grade Change History

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/gradebook/page.tsx`
- **How it works**: In the gradebook, a mock "View History" button has been added next to each grade input. Clicking it shows a toast notification simulating the retrieval of grade change history.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: In the Gradebook, click the history icon next to a grade.
  - **Result**: A toast message appears: "Loading grade history... (mock action)".
- **Gaps**: No actual log of grade changes is stored or displayed.

## 2. CBC/Competency-based Assessment Kit

### Feature: CBC Assessment Tool

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/academics/cbc/page.tsx`
- **How it works**: A new page allows teachers to select a class and rate students on predefined competencies (e.g., Communication, Critical Thinking) using a dropdown. The state is managed locally, and a "Save" button simulates persisting the data.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Navigate to `/academics/cbc`, select a student, and change their rating for "Communication".
  - **Result**: The UI updates to show the new rating. Clicking "Save" triggers a confirmation toast.
- **Gaps**: Assessments are not persisted to `localStorage` or a backend. It's a UI simulation of the workflow.

## 3. Predictive Analytics

### Feature: At-risk Student Detection & Performance Forecasting

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/analytics/predictive/page.tsx`
- **How it works**: This new page displays two components:
  1. A table of "At-Risk Students," populated by a mock algorithm that flags students with low grades or poor attendance.
  2. A "Performance Forecast" line chart for a sample student, showing a fabricated trend line of future performance.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Navigate to `/analytics/predictive`.
  - **Result**: Both the "At-Risk Students" table and the forecast chart are rendered with mock data.
- **Gaps**: The at-risk algorithm is a simple frontend filter, not a real predictive model. The forecast is static.

## 4. LMS Integrations

### Feature: Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, Zoom Integration Links

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/lms/page.tsx`
- **How it works**: The LMS dashboard now has an "LMS Integrations" card. It displays mock connections to platforms like Google Classroom, with buttons to "Connect" or "Sync," which trigger toast notifications to simulate the actions.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: On the LMS page, click the "Sync Now" button for Google Classroom.
  - **Result**: A toast notification appears: "Syncing with Google Classroom... (This is a mock action)".
- **Gaps**: No real API calls or data synchronization occurs.

---

## 5. Document Vault

### Feature: Secure Records, E-signature, Download History

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/academics/document-vault/page.tsx`
- **How it works**: A new "Document Vault" page displays a table of mock academic documents with their status (e.g., "Signed," "Pending Signature"). It includes buttons to simulate sending a document for e-signature or viewing its history, which trigger toast notifications.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: Navigate to the Document Vault and click "Send for Signature" on a pending document.
  - **Result**: A toast message confirms the action was sent for e-signature.
- **Gaps**: No documents are actually stored, sent, or signed. The entire feature is a UI/UX mock.

## Final Status

**Recommendation**: **Safe to proceed**. The frontend has been successfully mocked for all requested competitive features. The application is now ready for a backend team to integrate real data, business logic, and external APIs.
