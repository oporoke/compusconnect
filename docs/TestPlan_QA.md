# Test Plan & QA Strategy

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the testing strategy for the CampusConnect Lite application to ensure quality, reliability, and performance.

## 2. Testing Types

### 2.1. Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library.
- **Scope**: Individual components and hooks (`src/components`, `src/hooks`).
- **Goal**: Verify that each component renders correctly and each hook manages its state as expected.

### 2.2. Integration Testing
- **Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Scope**: Interactions between multiple components (e.g., creating a student and seeing them in the list).
- **Goal**: Ensure that different parts of the application work together seamlessly.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Framework**: Cypress or Playwright.
- **Scope**: Full user workflows across the application (e.g., login, navigate to gradebook, enter grades, save, logout).
- **Goal**: Simulate real user scenarios to validate the entire application stack.

## 3. Test Cases (Examples)

- **Authentication**:
  - `test('User can log in with a valid role')`
  - `test('User is redirected to /login if not authenticated')`
- **Student Management**:
  - `test('Admin can create a new student')`
  - `test('New student appears in the student list after creation')`
