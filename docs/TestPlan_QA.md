# Test Plan & Quality Assurance Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the CampusConnect Lite application to ensure its quality, reliability, and performance.

## 1. Quality Assurance Philosophy
Our QA philosophy is based on a multi-layered approach to testing. By combining unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, we aim to catch bugs early, prevent regressions, and ensure that new features meet the required quality standards before they are merged into the `main` branch.

## 2. Testing Types & Tools

### 2.1. Unit Testing
-   **Framework**: **Jest** with **React Testing Library**.
-   **Scope**: Individual, isolated React components and custom hooks (`src/components/*`, `src/hooks/*`).
-   **Goal**: To verify that each component renders correctly given a set of props and that each hook manages its state as expected in isolation. These tests are fast and run frequently during development.
-   **Example**: `tests/unit/Button.test.tsx`

### 2.2. Integration Testing
-   **Framework**: **Jest** with **React Testing Library**.
-   **Scope**: Interactions between multiple components that form a complete feature. For example, testing that creating a student via a dialog correctly updates the student list table.
-   **Goal**: To ensure that different parts of the application work together seamlessly. These tests cover user interactions within a specific page or feature set.
-   **Example**: `tests/integration/CreateStudent.test.tsx`

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
-   **Framework**: **Cypress** or **Playwright** (conceptual).
-   **Scope**: Full user workflows across the entire application, simulating real user behavior from start to finish.
-   **Goal**: To validate the complete application stack, including the frontend, backend API, and database interactions. E2E tests are the final gatekeeper for quality, ensuring that critical user journeys (like login, creating an invoice, or generating a report) work as expected in a production-like environment.
-   **Example**: `tests/e2e/login.cy.ts`

## 3. Code Review Process
-   All new code must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR) from a feature branch to the `main` branch.
-   Each PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer before it can be merged.
-   Reviewers are expected to check for code quality, adherence to coding standards, correctness of logic, and adequate test coverage.

## 4. Test Coverage
-   While a strict percentage is not enforced, all new features should be accompanied by relevant unit and/or integration tests.
-   Critical user flows, such as authentication and core CRUD operations, should have E2E test coverage.
-   Code coverage reports can be generated by running the test suite with the `--coverage` flag.

## 5. Performance Testing
-   Performance will be monitored using Next.js and browser developer tools.
-   Key metrics include initial page load time (Largest Contentful Paint), and response time for API calls and UI interactions.
-   The performance goals are outlined in the [SRS document](./srs.md#44-performance).

## 6. Release Management
-   The `main` branch is considered the source of truth for production releases.
-   Releases will be tagged using semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.1.0`).
-   A `CHANGELOG.md` file will be maintained to document notable changes in each release.
