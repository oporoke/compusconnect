- Use clear, universally recognizable icons for navigation and key actions (e.g., user profiles, attendance, schedules).
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout to ensure information is easily accessible and the platform feels intuitive.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations to enhance user interaction and provide a polished feel.
