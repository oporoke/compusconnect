## 1. Student Information Management

### Feature: Profiles, academic history, records

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/app/(app)/students/page.tsx`: Student listing.
  - `src/app/(app)/students/[id]/page.tsx`: Detailed student profile with academic history.
  - `src/components/students/create-student-dialog.tsx`: `handleSubmit` function for creating new records.
  - `src/hooks/use-students.tsx`: `addStudent` function for data persistence.
- **How it works**: The system provides a page to list all students. Users can click to view a detailed profile that includes contact info, grades, and attendance. A dialog form allows authorized users to create new student records, which are saved persistently in `localStorage`.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: A user fills out the "Create Student" form.
  - **Result**: The new student appears immediately in the student list. Data persists after a browser refresh.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 2. Attendance Management

### Feature: Daily logs & reports

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/app/(app)/attendance/page.tsx`: `handleSubmit` for logging daily attendance.
  - `src/hooks/use-students.tsx`: `logAttendance` for data persistence.
  - `src/app/(app)/students/[id]/page.tsx`: Displays the attendance report on the student profile.
- **How it works**: Teachers can select a class and mark students as present or absent for the day. This data is saved and used to dynamically calculate and display an attendance percentage on each student's profile page.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: A teacher marks a student as absent.
  - **Result**: The student's attendance percentage on their profile page is immediately updated to reflect the absence.
- **Gaps**: None for the core feature.

#### Feature: Biometric/RFID integration

- **Implemented?**: No.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: This is an advanced hardware integration feature that was deemed out of scope for the current development phase.

## 3. Timetable & Scheduling

### Feature: Auto-generation, conflict resolution, and online access

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/app/(app)/timetable/page.tsx`: Timetable generation interface.
  - `src/ai/flows/ai-timetable-assistant.ts`: The AI flow for generation and conflict resolution.
- **How it works**: An AI-powered assistant takes course details and instructor availability as input to automatically generate a conflict-free timetable. The "Timetable" page is accessible to all user roles for viewing.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: User provides course and instructor data and clicks "Generate".
  - **Result**: The AI returns a formatted, conflict-free timetable which is displayed on the screen.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 4. Examination & Grading

### Feature: Test setup and configurable grading system

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/app/(app)/exams/page.tsx`: `CreateExamDialog` for creating new exams with custom subjects.
  - `src/components/gradebook/gradebook-table.tsx`: `GradebookTable` dynamically adapts to the selected exam's subjects.
- **How it works**: A dedicated "Exams" page allows teachers to create examinations and define which subjects are part of them. The gradebook is now fully configurable, allowing grade entry for any subject within any created exam.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: A user creates a new exam called "Science Olympiad" with subjects "Physics, Biology".
  - **Result**: "Science Olympiad" appears as an option in the gradebook, which then displays columns for "Physics" and "Biology" scores.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Report cards

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/app/(app)/report-cards/page.tsx`: `handleDownload` for PDF generation.
  - `src/components/report-cards/report-card-generator.tsx`: Dynamically generates reports.
- **How it works**: Users can select a student and a specific exam to generate a personalized report card, complete with an AI-written summary. The generated report can then be downloaded as a PDF file.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: A user generates a report for a student and clicks "Download as PDF".
  - **Result**: The browser initiates a download for a PDF file named `[Student Name]_report_card.pdf`.
- **Gaps**: None.

## 5. Learning Management (LMS)

### Feature: Online classes, assignments, and resources

- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**:
  - `src/app/(app)/lms/assignments/page.tsx`: `CreateAssignmentDialog` and assignment submission logic.
  - `src/app/(app)/lms/course-materials/page.tsx`: `CreateMaterialDialog`.
  - `src/hooks/use-lms.tsx`: `submitAssignment`, `addAssignment`, `addCourseMaterial`, etc.
- **How it works**: The LMS module is fully interactive. Students can submit their assignments, and teachers/admins can create new assignments, upload course materials, and schedule online classes. All actions are persisted via `localStorage`.
- **Test Evidence**:
  - **Action**: A teacher creates a new assignment; a student logs in and clicks "Submit".
  - **Result**: The new assignment appears for the student. After submission, its status badge updates to "Submitted", and the change is saved.
- **Gaps**: None.

#### Feature: Progress tracking

- **Implemented?**: Yes (Implicitly).
- **How it works**: Progress is tracked through a combination of existing features:
  1. **Gradebook**: Shows scores for all exams.
  2. **Student Profile**: Displays academic history and grade trends.
  3. **LMS**: Shows the status of assignments (Pending, Submitted, Graded).
- **Gaps**: While all the data points exist, there is no single, consolidated "Progress Tracking" dashboard. This can be considered a future enhancement rather than a missing feature for the current scope.
