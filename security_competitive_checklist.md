# Security & Infrastructure Module: Competitive Feature Audit

## Module Summary
- **Implementation Status**: 100% (Mocked)
- **Critical Missing Features**: None within the mocked scope. A real backend is required for production security.
- **Recommendation**: **Safe to proceed**. The module provides a comprehensive frontend simulation of all required security features, ready for backend integration.

## 1. Data Protection Compliance

#### Feature: GDPR-like Policies (Export/Erase Workflows)
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/security/data-privacy/page.tsx`
- **How it works**: A new "Data & Privacy" page provides UI options for users to request a data export or account erasure. Clicking these buttons triggers a toast notification to simulate the initiation of the backend workflow.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Navigate to `/security/data-privacy` and click "Request Data Export".
    - **Result**: A toast message appears: "Data Export Requested. Your data export is being prepared and will be sent to your registered email. (This is a mock action)".
- **Gaps**: No backend process is actually initiated. This is a UI/UX mock of the GDPR compliance tools.

## 2. Audit Logs

#### Feature: Track All Sensitive Actions
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: 
    - `src/hooks/use-audit-log.tsx`: The `useAuditLog` hook provides a `logAction` function.
    - `src/app/(app)/security/audit-log/page.tsx`: Displays the logs.
- **How it works**: The `logAction` function is called from critical parts of the application (e.g., login, creating a student). These log entries are saved to `localStorage` and displayed on the Audit Log page for admins to review.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: A user logs in.
    - **Result**: A new entry appears on the Audit Log page with the action "User Logged In", the user's name, and a timestamp.
- **Gaps**: The logs are stored in `localStorage`, which is not secure or tamper-proof. A real implementation requires a dedicated, secure logging service.

## 3. Key Rotation & PII Encryption

#### Feature: Encryption for Sensitive Data
- **Implemented?**: No.
- **File & Function Name**: N/A.
- **How it works**: N/A.
- **Test Evidence**: N/A.
- **Gaps**: This is a backend-exclusive feature. It involves database-level encryption and secure key management practices that cannot be implemented or simulated on the frontend. It is documented here as out of scope for the frontend implementation.

## 4. MFA Expansion

#### Feature: Support for Google Authenticator & SMS OTP
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/components/auth/mfa-form.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The MFA form has been updated with tabs for "Authenticator App" and "SMS". This provides the UI for a multi-channel MFA experience. The underlying logic remains a mock where any 6-digit code is accepted.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: On the MFA screen, switch between the "Authenticator" and "SMS" tabs.
    - **Result**: The UI updates to show the relevant input method and instructions, demonstrating the user flow for different MFA options.
- **Gaps**: No actual integration with TOTP algorithms (for authenticator apps) or SMS gateways exists.

## Final Status
**Recommendation**: **Safe to proceed**. The frontend has been successfully mocked for all demonstrable security features. The application is now ready for a backend team to integrate these UIs with real security services and infrastructure.
