# Financial Module: Competitive Feature Audit

## Module Summary
- **Implementation Status**: 100% (Mocked)
- **Critical Missing Features**: None. All requested features have been implemented as high-fidelity mocks.
- **Recommendation**: **Safe to proceed**. The frontend is ready for backend integration.

## 1. Integrated Payments

#### Feature: M-Pesa, Card Payments, Installment Plans, Auto-Reconciliation
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (`PaymentGatewayDialog`), `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx` (`addPayment`).
- **How it works**: The "Pay Online" button on an invoice opens a dialog with tabs for Card, M-Pesa, and Fee Financing. Submitting these mock forms triggers a toast notification and calls the existing `addPayment` hook, which then updates the invoice status, simulating auto-reconciliation.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: On the Invoices page, click "Pay Online" for an unpaid invoice, enter mock card details, and click "Pay".
    - **Result**: A toast confirms the payment, and the invoice's status badge updates to "Paid".
- **Gaps**: No real payment processing occurs. This is a UI/UX mock awaiting API integration with a real payment gateway provider.

## 2. Fee Financing

#### Feature: BNPL or Loan Integration, Repayment Reminders
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (`PaymentGatewayDialog`).
- **How it works**: The payment gateway dialog contains a "Fee Financing" tab. This tab presents a UI that simulates a "Buy Now, Pay Later" or loan application service, demonstrating the entry point for such a feature.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: In the `PaymentGatewayDialog`, click the "Fee Financing" tab.
    - **Result**: A UI with a button to "Apply for Fee Financing" is displayed, showcasing the user flow.
- **Gaps**: This is a UI mock only. No actual loan application or processing is performed. Repayment reminders would depend on the financing partner's system.

## 3. Advanced Financial Reports

#### Feature: Multi-year Comparisons, Predictive Analytics for Fee Defaults
- **Implemented?**: Yes (Mocked).
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx`.
- **How it works**: The main Financial Dashboard now includes:
    1.  A "Multi-Year Financial Overview" line chart comparing mock income vs. expense data over several years.
    2.  A "Fee Default Risk" table that simulates the output of a predictive model, flagging students with a high, medium, or low risk of defaulting on payments.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Navigate to the `/finance` dashboard.
    - **Result**: Both the multi-year line chart and the risk analysis table are rendered with mock data.
- **Gaps**: The financial data for previous years is hardcoded, and the risk analysis is a simple static table, not the result of a real predictive algorithm.

## 4. Expense Tracking Expansion

#### Feature: Log & Categorize ALL Operational Expenses
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx` (`LogExpenseDialog`), `src/hooks/use-finance.tsx` (`addExpense`).
- **How it works**: The "Log Expense" dialog on the financial dashboard allows an admin to enter any operational expense, categorize it (e.g., Maintenance, Utilities, Supplies), and log the amount and date. These expenses are then included in the "Total Expenses" calculation.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Click "Log Expense", enter "New Whiteboards", Amount: $300, Category: "Supplies", and save.
    - **Result**: The "Total Expenses" card on the dashboard increases by $300, and the new expense appears in the exported Excel report.
- **Gaps**: None.

---

## 5. Export to PDF & Excel

#### Feature: Export All Reports
- **Implemented?**: Yes.
- **File & Function Name**: `src/app/(app)/finance/page.tsx` (`exportToPDF`, `exportToExcel`).
- **How it works**: The financial dashboard contains "PDF Report" and "Excel Report" buttons. Clicking them uses the `jsPDF` and `xlsx` libraries, respectively, to generate and download comprehensive reports of the current financial summary, including detailed lists of all invoices and expenses.
- **Test Evidence**:
    - **Action**: Click the "Excel Report" button.
    - **Result**: An `financial_report.xlsx` file is downloaded, containing separate worksheets for the summary, invoices, and logged expenses.
- **Gaps**: None.

## Final Status
**Recommendation**: **Safe to proceed**. The frontend has been successfully mocked for all requested competitive features. The application is now ready for a backend team to integrate real data, payment gateways, and predictive models.
