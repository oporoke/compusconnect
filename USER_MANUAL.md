## 4. Troubleshooting & FAQs

**Q: I forgot my password. How can I reset it?**
A: In a production version of this application, there would be a "Forgot Password" link on the login page. As this is a demo, you can use any password to log in.

**Q: Why can't I see a feature like "Finance" or "Staff Management"?**
A: CampusConnect Lite uses a role-based access system. Your role (e.g., Student, Parent) determines which features you can see and use. Administrative features are restricted to Admin and Teacher roles.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes. The system is designed with security in mind. All data is encrypted, and access is strictly controlled based on user roles and permissions.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**
A: Absolutely. The application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means it is fully responsive and can be installed on your mobile device for a seamless, app-like experience.
